Package: strongswan
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, strongswan-ikev1, strongswan-ikev2
Suggests: network-manager-strongswan
Description: IPsec VPN solution metapackage
 The strongSwan VPN suite is based on the IPsec stack in standard Linux 2.6
 kernels. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 StrongSwan is one of the two remaining forks of the original FreeS/WAN
 project and focuses on IKEv2 support, X.509 authentication and complete PKI
 support. For a focus on Opportunistic Encryption (OE) and interoperability
 with non-standard IPsec features, see Openswan.
 .
 This metapackage installs the packages required to maintain IKEv1 and IKEv2
 connections via ipsec.conf or ipsec.secrets.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, openssl
Conflicts: strongswan (<< 4.2.12-1)
Description: strongSwan utility and crypto library
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package provides the underlying library of charon and other strongSwan
 components. It is built in a modular way and is extendable through various
 plugins.

Package: strongswan-dbg

Section: debug
Priority: extra
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, strongswan, libstrongswan
Description: strongSwan library and binaries - debugging symbols
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package provides the symbols needed for debugging of strongswan.

Description: strongSwan daemon starter and configuration file parser
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 The starter and the associated "ipsec" script control both pluto and charon
 from the command line. It parses ipsec.conf and loads the configurations to
 the daemons. While the IKEv2 daemon can use other configuration backends, the
 IKEv1 daemon is limited to configurations from ipsec.conf.

Description: strongSwan Internet Key Exchange (v1) daemon
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 Pluto is an IPsec IKEv1 daemon. It was inherited from the FreeS/WAN
 project, but provides improved X.509 certificate support and other features.
 .
 Pluto can run in parallel with charon, the newer IKEv2 daemon.

Description: strongSwan Internet Key Exchange (v2) daemon
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 Charon is an IPsec IKEv2 daemon. It is
 written from scratch using a fully multi-threaded design and a modular
 architecture. Various plugins provide additional functionality.
 .
 This build of charon can run in parallel with pluto, the IKEv1 daemon.

Package: strongswan-nm

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, strongswan-ikev2
Recommends: network-manager-strongswan
Description: strongSwan plugin to interact with NetworkManager
 StrongSwan is an IPsec-based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This plugin provides an interface which allows NetworkManager to configure
 and control the IKEv2 daemon directly through D-Bus. It is designed to work
 in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
 a simple graphical frontend to configure IPsec based VPNs.
